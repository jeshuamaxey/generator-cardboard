{"name":"Generator Cardboard","tagline":"Yeoman generator that scaffolds out a Google Cardboard compatible virtual reality web app","body":"# Generator Cardboard [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jeshuamaxey/generator-cardboard.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jeshuamaxey/generator-cardboard)\r\n\r\n[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator that scaffolds out a web app complete with a virtual reality environment built with [THREE.js](http://threejs.org) which is [Google Cardboard](http://g.co/cardboard) compatible.\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ojYuQtb.png)\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* CSS Autoprefixing\r\n* Built-in preview server with LiveReload\r\n* Automagically compile Sass\r\n* Automagically lint your scripts\r\n* Automagically wire up your Bower components with [grunt-wiredep](#third-party-dependencies).\r\n* Awesome Image Optimization (via OptiPNG, pngquant, jpegtran and gifsicle)\r\n* Mocha Unit Testing with PhantomJS\r\n* Bootstrap for Sass (Optional)\r\n* Leaner Modernizr builds (Optional)\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n- Install: `npm install -g generator-cardboard`\r\n- Run: `yo cardboard`\r\n- Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview. `--allow-remote` option for remote access.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Third-Party Dependencies\r\n\r\n*(HTML/CSS/JS/Images/etc)*\r\n\r\nThird-party dependencies are managed with [grunt-wiredep](https://github.com/stephenplusplus/grunt-wiredep). Add new dependencies using **Bower** and then run the **Grunt** task to load them:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ bower install --save jquery\r\n$ grunt wiredep\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works if the package author has followed the [Bower spec](https://github.com/bower/bower.json-spec). If the files are not automatically added to your source code, check with the package's repo for support and/or file an issue with them to have it updated.\r\n\r\nTo manually add dependencies, `bower install --save depName` to get the files, then add a `script` or `style` tag to your `index.html` or another appropriate place.\r\n\r\nThe components are installed in the root of the project at `/bower_components`. To reference them from index.html, use `src=\"bower_components\"` or `src=\"/bower_components\"`. Treat the `bower_components` directory as if it was a sibling to `index.html`.\r\n\r\n*Testing Note*: a project checked into source control and later checked out needs to have `bower install` run from the `test` folder as well as from the project root.\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\n* `--skip-install`\r\n\r\n  Skips the automatic execution of `bower` and `npm` after scaffolding has finished.\r\n\r\n* `--test-framework=<framework>`\r\n\r\n  Defaults to `mocha`. Can be switched for another supported testing framework like `jasmine`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\nSee the [yeoman contributing docs](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/blob/master/contributing.md).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)\r\n","google":"UA-63850331-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
